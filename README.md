# Electricity-monitor-with-graph-on-Pi

'e2mon' is a Python3 programme to be run in raspbian stretch or later. It provides a graphical display of 
electricity consumption using nothing more than the flashing LED on a domestic meter panel display. 
Potentially more accurate than clip on induction types that do not exclusively measure real power.
It requires a modern (post2000?) domestic electricity meter with 1/1000th led indicator.
